# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Title

**FairStay** – A Transparent Accommodation Listing Platform

## Overview

In developing countries, individuals often face exploitation by self-styled “agents” who charge exorbitant fees to help them find rental accommodation. FairStay seeks to disrupt this system by enabling property owners to list accommodations directly, allowing renters to browse listings transparently.

---

## Goals

- Eliminate intermediary exploitation in accommodation rentals.
- Allow renters to explore listings with verified data, photos, and geolocation.
- Empower landlords to list their properties for free.
- Implement access controls via trial periods and mobile payments (e.g., Eco-cash).

---

## Target Users

- **Landlords**: Individuals with rental properties looking to list without middlemen.
- **Renters**: Individuals searching for fair, transparent accommodation.
