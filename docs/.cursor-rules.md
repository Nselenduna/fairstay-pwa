# Cursor Collaboration Rules

These are the guidelines and behavioral rules for using the Cursor editor on the **FairStay** project.

---

## ✅ General Guidelines

1. **Respect File Ownership**
   - Only edit files you're assigned to unless collaborating actively.
   - Use comments before making sweeping changes to shared components.

2. **Branching**
   - Work in feature branches for all tasks.
   - Use the `main` branch only for production-ready code.

3. **Commits**
   - Keep commit messages clear and conventional.
   - Example: `feat(upload): add image upload with geo support`

4. **Pull Requests**
   - PRs must be reviewed by at least one team member.
   - Use draft PRs for work in progress.

## 🖼️ UI & Styling

- Use Tailwind classes only.
- Ensure mobile-first responsiveness.
- Component files should be prefixed by their feature area, e.g., `ListingCard.tsx`.

---

## 🔐 Auth & Access

- Protect all upload and payment routes.
- Use `ProtectedRoute` wrapper for auth-gated pages.
- Store access state (`trial`, `paid`, `expired`) in user profile or session context.

---

## 📦 Listings & Upload

- All listing data must include:
  - Timestamp
  - User ID
  - Location (lat/lng)
  - Image URL(s)
- Validate all inputs before uploading to Firebase.

---

## 💸 Payments & Trials

- Do not allow trials to reset by email change.
- Use hashed phone numbers (e.g., SHA256) to track free trials.
- Listings are non-clickable and blurred when trial expires.

---

## 🔥 Performance

- Lazy load image galleries.
- Cache map API responses when possible.
- Use Firestore pagination for listing fetches.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Manual test each user flow on both mobile and desktop.
- Future: add Cypress or Playwright for key flows (auth, listing upload, payment).

---

## ☁️ Deployment

- Deploy to Vercel via GitHub integration.
- Every PR should trigger a Preview Deployment.
- PWA must pass Lighthouse audit with a score > 90.

---

## 🚫 Anti-Abuse

- Add CAPTCHA on registration.
- Limit listings per trial user (e.g., 2 max).
- Block re-use of phone numbers or emails after trial ends.
